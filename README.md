# CarDealership-Java

I wanted to learn a compiled statically typed language and so far Java is looking like a prime candidate. 

# PROS
1. Widespread.
2. Years worth of documentation.
3. Springboot & Hibernate ORM also well documented.
4. Knowing Java can segway into Android Development.
5. Simillar to C# in syntax and conventions.

# CONS
1. Test suites look pretty complicated.
2. While it holds the biggest market share, new development for Java doesn't seem proportional.
3. C# would be a better choice for game design, because of it's adoption by game engines; unity and unreal. 

# this exercise covered:
1. OOP
2. Setter and Getters
3. Demonstrates use of class types
4. Implements interfaces.
5. Communication between classes.
6. Uses 4 pillars of classes; encapsulation, polymorphism, inheretence, abstraction.
